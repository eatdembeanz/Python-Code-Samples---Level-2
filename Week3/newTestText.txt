Mathematics is the study of numbers, quantity, space, pattern, structure, and change. 
Applied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to other fields, inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new mathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. 
There is no clear line separating pure and applied mathematics, and practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered.
